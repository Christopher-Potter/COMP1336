I graduated from Hampton University with a B.S. in Computer Science. I’m a software engineer at Google, working on tablet integration for the [Google Home App (GHA)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1). This semester, I’m taking a sabbatical from my work at Google to come teach this class full-time!
